\section*{Background}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background}

Adaptation is the process in which beneficial traits
are acquired by organisms in a population through time.
%
This process is driven by natural selection.
%
Adaptive traits are ultimately encoded in the genetic material of organisms,
and therefore adaptation is often thought of in terms of adaptive alleles.
%
One of the goals of evolutionary research
is to understand the genetic basis of adaptation.
%
For example, do populations introduced to a new environment
adapt from new mutations or from ``standing genetic variation''
(i.e., allelic variation present in the population) \citep{orr05}?
%
Questions like this require detailed analyses of genetic data,
such as tracking individual alleles through time \citep{bar08}.



Speciation, the process by which new species form,
is often a by-product of adaptation \citep{coy04,sch09,sob10}.
%
Populations that evolve independently are likely to adapt in different ways
and therefore diverge genetically.
%
Genetic differences are likely to create ecogeographic, morphological,
physiological, or genetic isolation between populations \citep{coy04,sch10},
collectively known as ``reproductive isolation.''
%
For example, populations may not recognize each other as potential mates
or may produce sterile or inviable hybrids.
%
Many speciation researchers are interested
in the genetic mechanisms that lead to reproductive isolation.
%
Like in studies of the genetic basis of adaptation,
an understanding of the genetic basis of speciation
requires detailed analyses of genetic data.



A detailed study of adaptation and speciation
requires identifying individual alleles
and tracking them through time, which is no easy task.
%
Computational and mathematical models of adaptation
have been developed to study this process theoretically.
%
Models, however, miss some of the complexities of real, evolving organisms.

\section*{Study system: Avida}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Study system: Avida}
\label{sec:avida}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of Avida;
for a full description, see \cite{ofr04}.
%
Avida is freely available at \url{http://avida.devosoft.org}.
%
In Avida, digital organisms are composed of
a linear sequence of instructions (akin to a haploid genome),
memory space in the form of registers and stacks,
pointers to memory locations,
and a central processing unit (CPU) that executes instructions.
%
The instruction set makes up an assembly-like programming language,
consisting of instructions for arithmetic operations,
memory manipulation (e.g., swapping registers or pushing into a stack),
conditional execution, iteration, input/output operations,
and allocation and copying of memory.
%
Organisms execute their instructions sequentially,
sometimes skipping instructions for conditional statements
or repeating the same instructions inside a loop;
when the last instruction is executed,
execution starts again at the first instruction.
%
By executing instructions in their genomes,
organisms are able to (1) replicate and (2) perform computational `tasks'
that increase the speed at which they replicate and thus increase fitness.



To replicate, an allocation instruction creates the memory space
required by the organism's offspring, and a copy instruction inside a loop
allows the organism to copy itself into the new memory space.
%
The copy instruction that allows organisms to replicate
has a configurable probability of making mistakes,
which introduces various kinds of mutations.
%
By default, replication is asexual.
%
However, Avida may be configured to perform sexual replication,
in which the genomes of two asexually-produced offspring are recombined
by exchanging two randomly-sized regions of their genomes.
%
The offspring (whether clonal or recombinants) are put into the population
in random locations, replacing whatever organisms were already there.
%
Generations are therefore overlapping, as offspring are born continuously,
replacing older individuals but who are likely not their parents.



In addition to replication, genomic instructions allow organisms
to acquire 32-bit input values and use them to perform computational tasks.
%
Tasks are boolean operations, such as NOT, AND, and OR,
and are applied to input values bit by bit.
%
For example, if input values were 8 bits,
the operation 10011101 AND 11101011 would produce 10001001
according to the rules of boolean logic for AND
(0~AND~0~=~0, 0~AND~1~=~0, 1~AND~0~=~0, and 1~AND~1~=~1.
%
In Avida, however, there is no AND operation nor any other boolean operation
except for NAND, from which all other boolean operations may be built,
a property of NAND known as `functional completeness' in boolean algebra.
%
For example, P~AND~Q, where P and Q are input values,
is equivalent to (P~NAND~Q)~NAND~(P~NAND~Q).
%
Therefore, in order to perform a task other than NAND,
digital organisms must make use of other instructions available,
which arise through mutation or recombination.



When an organism performs a task, the organism's `merit' is increased
by a specific amount, specified in a configuration file, for that task.
%
The merit of an organism is a unitless value used by Avida
to determine the number of instructions an organism may execute each time step.
%
If two organisms had the same merit,
they would execute the same number of instructions at each time step;
however, if one organism had twice the merit as another,
the first organism would execute twice the number of instructions
compared to the second in a single time step.
%
Thus, an organism with twice the merit as another
would replicate twice as fast.
%
Organisms initially inherit the merit of their parents;
otherwise, new organisms would be at a disadvantage
compared to the rest of the population.
%
The default environment rewards for nine binary (i.e., two-input) tasks.



Adaptation in Avida occurs naturally (i.e., it is not simulated),
as a result of the three ingredients required for natural selection:
inheritance, variation, and differential reproduction.
%
Inheritance comes from replication (sexual or asexual),
variation comes from mutation and recombination,
and differential reproduction comes from their rate of replication
(determined by their replication code and performance of tasks).
%
The ability to perform tasks evolves as organisms with the right mutations
replicate faster than others and therefore take over the population.
%
There are many ways in which to perform any one task,
and independently evolved organisms often evolve the same task
in different ways and with different degrees of efficiency.



\section*{Dissertation summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Dissertation summary}

Evolutionary adaptation to a new environment
depends on the availability of beneficial alleles.
%
Beneficial alleles may appear as new mutations
or may come from standing genetic variation---%
alleles already present in the population
prior to the environmental change.
%
Adaptation from standing genetic variation
in sexually-reproducing populations
is expected to be faster than from new mutations
because beneficial alleles from standing genetic variation
occur at a higher starting frequency and are immediately available.
%
The distribution of fitness effects of alleles
from standing genetic variation are expected to be different
from that of new mutations because standing genetic variation
has been `pre-tested' by selection.
%
Whether adaptation uses standing genetic variation
or new mutations as a source of beneficial alleles is unknown.
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:sgv} (p.~\pageref{chap:sgv}),
I conducted experimental evolution of digital organisms
to determine the source of beneficial alleles during adaptation.
%
I also tested the speed of adaptation
and the fitness effect of alleles
under these two sources of genetic variation.



Various processes may drive a biological population to acquire mutations
that reduce its fitness (i.e., ``deleterious mutations'').
%
A population with deleterious mutations may fully or partially recover
in fitness in two ways: reversion or compensatory adaptation.
%
Compensatory adaptation is the fixation of mutations
that ameliorate the effects of deleterious mutations
while the original deleterious mutations remain fixed.
%
Reversion is often the best way to recover and,
if a revertant mutation were to appear, the most probable route.
%
However, it has been found experimentally that
there are more compensatory mutations available
than the single revertant.
%
It has also been found that once compensatory adaptation
has begun, reversion becomes an increasingly improbable route
because the effect of the reversion changes with the genetic background.
%
Therefore, it seems that reversion has a limited
window of opportunity in which its full effect would be beneficial.
%
The fitness effect of the deleterious mutation,
the population size, and the mutation rate are three main factors
that will affect this window of opportunity.
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:comp_rate} (p.~\pageref{chap:comp_rate}),
we used populations of digital organisms
to investigate the effect of these factors.
%
We found that the lower the initial fitness of the population,
the smaller the window of opportunity for reversion.
%
This result was partly caused by the stronger negative interactions
between compensatory mutations and the reversion.
%
We found that the window of opportunity for reversion
was highest the larger the population size,
but compensatory adaptation was most probable
at intermediate population sizes and lowest at the extremes.
%
Finally, we found that the higher the mutation rate,
the larger the window of opportunity reversion,
but it was smaller than expected because
the higher mutation rate caused more negative interactions
with compensatory mutations to occur.



Epistatic interactions among compensatory mutations that have
evolved in separate populations may form an intrinsic
postzygotic isolating barrier (i.e., hybrid inviability or sterility),
leading to biological speciation.
%
Indeed, about ten percent of genetic differences between species
comprise compensatory mutations.
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:comp_spp} (p.~\pageref{chap:comp_spp}),
I tested experimentally whether compensatory adaptation
can lead to reproductive isolation (specifically, postzygotic isolation)
and whether it was more rapid and stronger
than in populations evolved through drift.
%
Surprisingly, the strength of this isolation was independent
of the effect size of the original deleterious mutations.
%
We also find that
both deleterious and compensatory mutations
contribute equally to reproductive isolation.
%
Our results suggest that compensatory adaptation may be
an important genetic mechanism of speciation,
and supports the view that intrinsic postzygotic isolation
can stem from intrinsic genetic mechanisms.



Reproductive isolation between populations often evolves as a byproduct of
independent adaptation to new environments, but the selective pressures of
these environments may be divergent (`ecological speciation') or uniform
(`mutation-order speciation').
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:ecol_mo} (p.~\pageref{chap:ecol_mo}),
we directly compare the strength of reproductive isolation
(specifically, postzygotic) generated by
ecological and mutation-order processes.
%
We also tested the effect of gene flow as well as the dimensionality
(i.e., number of selective pressures) of the environments on the strength
of postzygotic isolation.
%
We found that ecological speciation generally formed stronger isolation than
mutation-order speciation, mutation-order speciation was more sensitive to gene
flow than ecological speciation, and environments with high dimensionality
formed stronger reproductive isolation than those with low dimensionality.
%
How various factors affect the strength of reproductive isolation
has been difficult to test in biological organisms, but the
use of artificial life, which provides its own genetic system that evolves,
allowed us to computationally test the effect of these factors more easily.



Under the Dob\-zhan\-sky-Mul\-ler model of speciation,
hybrid inviability or sterility results from the evolution
of genetic incompatibilities (DMIs) between species-specific alleles.
%
This model predicts that the number of pairwise DMIs between species
should increase quadratically through time,
but the few tests of this `snowball effect' have had conflicting results.
%
In Chapter~\ref{chap:snowball} (p.~\pageref{chap:snowball}),
we show that pairwise DMIs accumulated quadratically,
supporting the snowball effect.
%
The number of unfit hybrids has been proposed to accumulate faster
than quadratically because hybrids harbor more complex DMIs,
but we found that the accumulation was linear.
%
We show that more complex genetic interactions involved alleles
that rescued pairwise incompatibilities, explaining the discrepancy
between the accumulations of DMIs versus unfit hybrids.
%
Our results highlight the importance
of complex genetic interactions in speciation.
