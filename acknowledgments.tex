I would like to thank my advisor, Dr.\ Barry Williams,
for taking me under his mentorship.
%
Barry has been an excellent source of ideas
that have helped me frame and focus my dissertation.
%
He has always been easy to talk to,
and his open-door policy welcomed conversation.
%
Barry has been very supportive throughout my time here
and open to my exploration of new topics,
some of which turned out to be chapters in my dissertation.
%
Finally, Barry nominated me as the EEBB Distinguished Speaker
and has helped me make professional connections,
all of which have furthered my career as a scientist.



I would like to thank my dissertation committee,
Dr.\ Richard Lenski, Dr.\ Charles Ofria, and Dr.\ Doug Schemske.
%
They have been incredibly helpful
in developing my ideas and focusing my research.
%
I always looked forward to my committee meetings
because I knew I would come away with great insights.
%
Listening to them discuss science was always inspiring.
%
I would also like to thank Luke Harmon,
who collaborated with me on one of my chapters.
%
Luke has been very positive and cared for my well-being
because he usually started our conversations with ``Are you having fun?''
%

Vicki Rademacher, Kristine Cox, Krista Reitenga, and Siva Nallasivam
did a lot of the lab work that some of my research explorations relied upon.
%
Alex Prediger, Bahaar Chawla, Molly Roseland, and other undergraduates
helped me run experiments or kept the lab clean and well-supplied.
%
I thank my fellow graduate lab members, Krista Reitenga, Katy Califf,
Chris Hamm, Cory Kohn, and Michael Grispo.
%
I would also like to thank the Devolab for their great feedback
during lab presentations that have greatly improved my research.
%
Several people (including friends named later) offered great comments
on parts of my work, especially Dr.\ Ian Dworkin, Dr.\ Aleeza Gerstein,
Dr.\ Daniel Matute, Emily Weigel, and Dr.\ Sonal Singhal.
%
I would like to thank Dr.\ Danita Brandt, Dr.\ Michael Velbel,
Dr.\ Michael Gottfried, Dr.\ Robert Anstey, and Summer Ostrowski

I would like to thank the many people who worked in the background,
who made my life a little easier: Brian Baer, Pat Bills, Dirk Colbry, Rob Lyon,
Lisa Craft, Julia Ahmed, Pat Resler, and Connie James.
%
Dr.\ Clifford Weil taught me \LaTeX\ and provided me with the template that
helped create this beautiful-looking dissertation.
%
My work would have been impossible without the many agencies and organizations
that funded me: Michigan State University, the Department of Zoology,
the Quantitative Biology Initiative, the Graduate School,
the Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Behavior (EEBB) Program,
and the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action.



Throughout my six years here, I have made some amazing friends,
which alone has made this experience worthwhile.
%
I especially thank Eli Swanson, Austin Dreyer, and Nick Testa.
